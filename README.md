## How to run client:
```
To run the game client you need to put decompressed EO graphics in client_engine/data/gfx/ folder. You also need to create config.ini in client_engine/data/ folder; config-example.ini may be helpful for that.
```
## How to run server:
```
In order to run the game server you need to create config.ini. There's also config-example.ini for the game server.
You need to create new SQLite3 database. (example database: server_engine/data/eo.db).
```
